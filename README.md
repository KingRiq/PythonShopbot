Uses selenium to assist Saira in purchasing a purse she wants

Must have selenium installed

pip3 install selenium I think is the right command. I'll update this.

* pip3 install selenium
* pip3 install select
* chmod 755 buy (this doesnt work because YOU did not create the file I believe)
* ./buy.sh to run

if it doesnt work I have no clue why LOL I will update this branch I hope!
